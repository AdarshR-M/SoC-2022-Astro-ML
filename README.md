# SoC-2022-Astro-ML
This project deals with applications of Machine Learning techniques in the field of Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Cataloging various types of objects such as pulsars/exoplanets/QSOs etc, through sky surveys, is very important in Astronomy. Now we have many telescopes/sky surveys that generate a huge amount of data everyday. After data processing, astronomers have to classify (or check if the data corresponds to the type of object we are looking for/trying to find) the objects. After the data processing and some analysis, astronomers are left with lakhs of candidates. People sitting and classifying each of them is infeasible and impossible. So we will have to train ML algorithms to do this for us. 

In this project, we first learnt basics of ML and then applied it to one simple astronomical context of classifying the objects into stars/galaxies/QSOs based on their redshifts and magnitudes. We did 3 assignments in this project.
