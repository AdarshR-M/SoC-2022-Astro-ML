# SoC-2022-Astro-ML
We have learnt about linear and logistic regression and basics of neural networks.
Now we have been given some reading material on Astronomy. But the work is temporarily paused (this week and next) as we have our endsems.\
We were given 2 assignments. The code for those is in the folders Week-1 and Week-2. All the books referred are also in the folders.
